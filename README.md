## Prerequisites for the course

- Basic command line 
- Basic knowledge about NGS data structure: reads, alignments (BAM), quality scores or attendance of "BIO609 Introduction to Linux and Bash Scripting" and "BIO610 Next-Generation Sequencing 1"

## Installation Instructions for Docker

Please follow the instruction on https://github.com/grexor/teachingDocker to install and setup the Docker environment we will use during this class.

## Recommended books (Practical Computing Skills)

- [Haddock & Dunn. Practical Computing for Biologists. Sinauer Associates 2011.](http://practicalcomputing.org)  
  A good book that covers the shell/command line, programming in python & bash, databases, regular expressions. 
  Suitable for self-study and as a reference book.

- [Vince Buffalo. Bioinformatics Data Skills. O'reilly 2015](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030157.do)  
  This practical book teaches the skills that scientists need for turning large sequencing datasets into reproducible and robust biological findings.
  Also covers methods on Sequence and Alignment Data. 
  More advanced than Haddock & Dunn and progresses with faster pace.
